## you would like to build this example of use of the CPCtelera Engine.  ##
## Below you will find several configuration sections with the macros    ##
## available to configure the build, along with explanation comments to  ##
## help you understand what they do. Please, change everything you want. ##

## SECTION 1: COMPILER CONFIGURATION
##
## Under this section you find the macros that set up the compiler executables
## that will be used for code compilation. Under Linux systems you would normally
## have your compiler installed in a directory that is added to the path (like
## /usr/bin, for instance). If this is not the case, or you are running under
## Windows, or Cygwin, try to put the executables with full path.
##
## Z80ASM      >> Assembler source compiler. Used to compile .s files written in Z80 Assembler.
## Z80ASMFLAGS >> Flags to be used for compilation with SDASZ80
## Z80LNK      >> Z80 Linker, used to link togheter .rel files into a library module

## SECTION 2: LIBRARY CONFIG
##
## This section establishes source and object subfolders and the binary objects to
## be built. Normally, you want to change the OBJ files you want to be built, selecting
## only the ones that contain the actual code that will be used by you in your application.
##
## SRCDIR   >> Directory under which assembly source files are located
## OBJDIR   >> Directory where generated intermediate object files will be written to
## OBJFILES >> intermediate .rel files that will be needed for your application (their names
##             have to correspond to existing source files in the SRCDIR, but with .rel extension)
