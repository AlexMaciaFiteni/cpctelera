    <title>AMSprite - Amstrad CPC Sprite Editor</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        AMSprite is designed to make cross-platform development of Amtrad CPC games 
        easier. It can produce sprites and loading screens in both Mode 0, 1 or 2. It 
        could also be used to create ZX Spectrum monochrome sprites when set to Mode 2.</p>
    <p>
        Sprites can be of any user-defined dimensions. The palette (16 colours mode 0, 4 
        colours mode 1, 2 colours mode 2) is fully customisable and the original colours are authentically 
        represented.</p>
    <p>
        All output is in MAXAM/WinApe compatible assembly language that can be copied 
        and pasted into your favourite cross-platform environment.</p>
    <p>
        Loading screen binary data is output in byte order for direct loading into 
        screen memory. Sprite binary data is output in lines from top to bottom.</p>
    <h2>
        Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        A file in AMSprite (.amsx) consists of a set of Sprites and Loading Screens. 
        When the program is first run, you are presented with a blank list, set to mode 
        0 with the default palette. Click the &quot;New Sprite&quot; button at bottom left and 
        enter a name and dimensions (for a sprite), or just a name (for a loading 
        screen). A new blank image will be created. Select foreground and background pen 
        colours by left-clicking or right-clicking the coloured buttons at top right. 
        You can now draw points and lines on the canvas at right. A preview is shown at 
        bottom right.</p>
    <h2>
        Importing/Exporting Images</h2>
    <p>
        AMSprite allows the importing of external images for use as sprites or loading 
        screens, and the export of blank images in .png format with the amstrad palette 
        pre-configured for use in your favourite paint program.</p>
    <p>
        To import an image, first select the inks and mode to best match your image. 
        Then click the &quot;Import Image&quot; button on the toolbar.</p>
