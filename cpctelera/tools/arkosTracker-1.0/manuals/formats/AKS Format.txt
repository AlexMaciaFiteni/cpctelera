AKS Format 1.0
--------------

The AKS format is generated by the Arkos Tracker. I will be very concise here : it is simply an XML file that is GZIPed (WinRAR should be able to uncompress it).
It includes the AKI format which is used for the Instruments.

Explode the file and have fun, it's very easy to understand :).
