*BEWARE. This documentation is currently under construction.*

CPCtelera Android Exporter Beta is a module of the build system that lets you export 
your Amstrad CPC creations to Android. Once you have your Amstrad CPC game ready,
you can launch the Android Exporter with the command *make apk* and an Android 
APK package will be generated. This APK will contain your game in snapshot format 
along with RVMEngine, an embeded versión of Retro Virtual Machine 2 emulator.


Next sections will show you how to configure and use CPCtelera Android Exporter Beta.

Section: Functionalities

   CPCtelera Android Exporter Beta and RVM Engine give you these functionalities,
     * Fully working Amstrad CPC games on Android 4.4+ with RVMEngine embedded emulator
     * Configurable Splash Screen
     * Configurable Icons for your Android App
     * Configurable Control layouts and keymapping
     * Savestates on Android
     * Use of Android virtual keyboard to insert any character

Section: Requisites
   
   In order for your game and android device to work with CPCtelera Android Exporter, 
these requisites must be met,
   * Only 64K shapnshots from Amstrad CPC 464 are allowed.
   * The game cannot read from tape or disk, nor it can include custom ROMs.
   * Android device must have API 19+ (Android 4.4 KitKat or higher).
