.module cpct_sprites

;;
;; Array: cpct_transparentMaskTableM0
;;
;;    Look-up table (array) containing all the masks for the 256 possible combinations of
;; byte pixel data values, assuming firmware colour 0 as being transparent. This table
;; should be placed by users at their desired location in memory. 
;;
;;    It is recommended to place this table at a 256-byte aligned memory location (a memory 
;; location whose Least signficant byte is 0, so the address has the form 0x??00). In fact, 
;; some functions like <cpct_drawSpriteMaskedAlignedTable> require this table to be 256-byte
;; aligned or they will fail.
;; 
;;    To be able to use this table, all you have to do is declaring it in your code, like this:
;; (start code)
;;    extern const u8 cpct_transparentMaskTableM0;
;; (end code)
;;
;;    If you want to place this table at a specific location in your memory, at compile time, 
;; you should ask the compiler to do it for you. Imagine you want to place it at 0x2100 (a 256-byte
;; aligned address); you should do it this way:
;; (start code)
;;    __at(0x2100) extern const u8 cpct_transparentMaskTableM0;
;; (end code)
;;
;; Size:
;;    256 bytes
